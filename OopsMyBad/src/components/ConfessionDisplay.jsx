        Dear You,
        <br />
        <br />
        I messed up. I said things I didnâ€™t mean and hurt you in the worst way.
        Every moment since, Iâ€™ve been haunted by the silence between us.
        <br />
        <br />
        You didnâ€™t deserve that, and Iâ€™d do anything to take it back. This
        apology is not enoughâ€”but itâ€™s the only place I can start.
        <br />
        <br />
        Iâ€™m sorry. Truly. Deeply.
      </p>

        Iâ€™ve Read It ðŸ˜¶
